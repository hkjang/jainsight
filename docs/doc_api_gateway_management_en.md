# API Management

Monitor and control the lifecycle of your SQL-based APIs.

## API Cards

Each created API is displayed as a card containing:

- **Method**: Indicates the HTTP method (typically GET/POST).
- **Parameters Count**: Number of dynamic inputs accepted.
- **SQL Preview**: A summary of the underlying logic.

## Security & Access

- **API Key**: Each API is secured with a unique API Key.
  - **Visibility**: Click the "Eye" (👁️) icon to reveal the key.
  - **Copy**: One-click copy for secure sharing.
- **Endpoint**: The full URL endpoint is generated automatically. Use the "Copy Endpoint" button to get the URL for your frontend or client application.

## Documentation

- **Docs Button**: Auto-generates an OpenAPI / Swagger interface for the specific endpoint, allowing external teams to understand how to consume your API.
