# NL2SQL Policies

Define sophisticated rules to control how Natural Language is converted to SQL.

## Policy Controls

- **DDL/DML Blocking**: Toggle switches to block `CREATE`/`DROP` (DDL) or `INSERT`/`UPDATE` (DML) statements generated by AI.
- **Injection Checks**: Enable AI-based analysis to detect prompt injection attempts.
- **PII Masking**: Automatically mask sensitive columns (like SSN, Credit Card) in the results.
- **Row Limits**: Enforce maximum row counts (e.g., 1,000 rows) to prevent data dumping.

## Presets

Quickly apply standard security postures:

- **Read-Only (Conservative)**: Blocks all modifications, enforces strict masking.
- **Analyst (Standard)**: Allows more rows, keeps DDL blocked.
- **Developer (Flexible)**: Allows DDL/DML for development schemas.
