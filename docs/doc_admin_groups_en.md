# Group Management

Organize users into logical structures for easier permission management and collaboration.

## Group Hierarchy

The left panel displays a tree view of your organizations and teams using three levels:

1.  **Organization (Building Icon)**: Top-level division.
2.  **Project (Folder Icon)**: Mid-level grouping.
3.  **Task (Clipboard Icon)**: Specific functional unit.

## Creating Groups

- **Manual Group**: Create a group by name, type, and parent group.
- **Auto Group**: Define a JSON condition (e.g., `{"emailDomain": "@dev.com"}`) to automatically add matching users to this group upon registration or update.

## Members

Select a group to manage its membership.

- **View**: See list of users in the group.
- **Remove**: Remove a user from the specific group.
- **Stats**: View the total count of members per group type (Organization, Project, Task) at a glance.
