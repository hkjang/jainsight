# AI Assistance

Leverage the power of generative AI to write queries faster and visualize data effortlessly.

## Text-to-SQL

Instead of writing complex SQL manually, simply type your intent in natural language.

1. Click the **AI Assist** button in the toolbar.
2. Enter a prompt like: _"Show me the top 5 users by order count in the last month."_
3. The AI generates the corresponding SQL, which you can insert directly into the editor.

## Smart Explanations

Struggling to understand a complex query? Highlight it and ask the AI to "Explain this." using the right-click menu or toolbar.

## Data Visualization

The editor can automatically generate charts from your results.

- **Pie Charts**: Great for categorical distributions (e.g., User Status).
- **Bar Charts**: Ideal for comparing numeric values (e.g., Sales by Region).
- **Auto-Detection**: The system automatically suggests the best chart type based on your result columns.
