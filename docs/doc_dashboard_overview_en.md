# Dashboard Overview

The **Dashboard** serves as the central command center for the Jainsight Enterprise DB Hub. It provides immediate visibility into the system's health, your connection status, and recent query activities.

## Key Components

The dashboard is divided into four main sections:

1.  **Header & Status**: simpler greeting, system health status, and primary navigation buttons.
2.  **Statistics Grid**: Real-time metrics on connections and query performance.
3.  **Recent Activity**: A live feed of the latest queries executed across the platform.
4.  **Quick Actions**: Keyboard-accessible shortcuts to frequently used tools.

## Accessing the Dashboard

You can return to the dashboard at any time by:

- Clicking the **Jainsight** logo in the top-left corner of the sidebar.
- Clicking **Dashboard** in the "Workspace" menu group.
- Navigating to the root URL `/`.

## Header Area

The header welcomes you with a time-sensitive greeting (e.g., "Good morning") and displays your username.

- **System Status**: A pulsing green indicator confirms that the system is operational.
- **Primary Actions**:
  - **+ New Connection**: Quickly navigate to the creation page for a new database connection.
  - **⚡ SQL Editor**: Jump directly to the SQL query editor interface.
